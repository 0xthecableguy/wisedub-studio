## Overview

**Uniframe Studio** is an intelligent dubbing system designed to automate the process of video translation and voiceover with high temporal precision. It synthesizes a new audio track using TTS models and precisely aligns the original video to match the timing of the new voiceover.

## üîÑ Workflow

### Audio Pipeline

1. **Extract audio** from video.
2. **Transcribe** with both segment-level and word-level timestamps to support the system‚Äôs meaning-aware translation process.
3. **Transcript correction** (prepare transcription segments for translation).
4. **Translate** each corrected segment into the target language.
5. **Voiceover** generation using TTS:
   - ElevenLabs (including original voice cloning)
   - OpenAI (multiple voice options)
6. **Audio synthesis**: Build the final audio track (mono and stereo versions).

### Video Alignment

1. **Split original video into segments** using transcript timestamp data.
2. **Stretch/compress video segments** to match new voiceover segment durations.
3. **Merge adjusted segments** into a final video synced with the new audio track.
